### Hi, I’m Michał 👋

I’m a full-stack software engineer building web applications end-to-end — from idea and architecture to deployment and maintenance.

I help businesses automate processes and implement AI-driven solutions that improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and support scalable growth.

I combine commercial experience with my own product projects, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

AI is part of my daily workflow — used as a development accelerator and analysis tool — while I retain full ownership of system design and code quality.

### 🔧 What I work on
- End-to-end web applications  
- Process automation & AI-powered workflows  
- Scalable backend systems and integrations  
- CI/CD, deployments, and infrastructure automation  

---

_Open to B2B collaboration and interesting full-time roles._
