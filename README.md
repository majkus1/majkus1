<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Michal Lipka</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a Web Developer, and I really enjoy my work. I started my journey in 2021, taking on my first projects. In December 2023, I got hired in a professional position for the first time. Additionally, I am a third-year Computer Science student. I'm focused on growth and open to new collaborations. Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you'd like! :)</h3>
